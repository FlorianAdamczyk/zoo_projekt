This is a Project from a Module we have in University where we learn to do web-develloping.
In that University course we have a weekly homework to devellop our website for a fictional Zoo. 

Right now we are adding a design with CSS.

The site is live at:
[zooprojekt.netlify.app](http://zooprojekt.netlify.app)

This is a Project from a Module we have in University where we learn to do web-develloping. 
We don't take us that serius and it's our first time using Git and HTML. 
In that University course we have a weekly homework to devellop our website for a fictional Zoo. 
I (or rather BingAI) thought it would be funny to call it Zarathustra.
